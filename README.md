# My Personal website

I chose to go with a relatively vanilla stack for this site as I did not see the need for a library such as React just yet. HTML, JS and Sass were exactly what I needed as there is very little interactivity needed here.

Two libraries were used for animations, Animate.css to create entrance animations and tsParticles for the background of the website.
